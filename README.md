# InstaNotes
A simple note-taking app that supports Markdown.

### Why this project
I wanted a note-taking app that mimics the simplicity of writing on paper. Itâ€™s intended only for day-to-day thoughts and things.

Technologies used:
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/): Used this because I am using it on my dev machine (macOS) and my desktop (Linux), so I needed something that supported both platforms.
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3) npm package for storing the note info.
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) Component library for the UX.
